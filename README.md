# 5G-UAV-Emulation-Framework
I made a 5G emulation framework, using mininet-wifi, ONOS and QoS-Slicing. I implemented dynamic movement for UAV's, and performed performance tests. This project focusses on SDN, Network slicing and QoS.
I wrote a whole portfolio about this project on Notion, you can access this via: https://stormy-crown-932.notion.site/Master-Thesis-on-5G-Emulation-for-UAV-Services-5a9620531dcf4b50a1bd86f28ce30547?pvs=4
